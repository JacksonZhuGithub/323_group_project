 10  systolic  
         refers to the higher number in a blood pressure reading, which measures the pressure in arteries when heart beats. A normal blood pressure level is less than 120/80 mmHg, wchich means the systolic blood pressure is 120mmHg.[1] A prehypertension systolic blood pressure level is 120-139 mmHg. A hypertensin (high blood pressure) systolic blood pressure level is 140 or higher mmHg.
         
 11  relaxation    
         refers to the lower number in a blood pressure reading which measures the pressure in arteries when heart rests between beats. Normally referred as diastolic blood pressure. Normal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg, 80-89mmHg for prehypertension, and 90mmHg and higher for hypertension.
     
 12  fasting blood sugar  
         measure blood sugar after an overnight fast (not eating) commonly used to diagnose and monitor diabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 99mg/dL or lower is normal, 100-125 mg/dL for prediabetes, and 126mg/dL or higher for diabetes. [2]
         
 13  Cholesterol  
        a type of lipid to measure the risk for heart disease. Total cholesterol=HDL + LDL + 20% triglycerides. A healthy total cholesterol is under 200 mg/dL. [3]
 14  triglyceride        
         A type of fat.  A healthy triglyceride level is generally considered to be less than 150 mg/dL. [4]
 15  HDL       
         high density cholesterol, ideally above 60mg/dL.[3]
 16  LDL 
         low density cholesterol, ideally below 100mg/dL.[3]
 17  hemoglobin           
         The normal range of hemoglobin levels can vary by sex. In males, the typical range is between 14.0 and 17.5 gm/dL, and between 12.3 and 15.3 gm/dL in females. If hemoglobin levels fall below 13.5 gm/dL in males or 12 gm/dL in females, it is considered a severe case of low hemoglobin. [6]
         
 18  Urine protein        
         For a random urine sample, normal values are 0 to 14 mg/dL. [5]  The range for this variable is from 1 to 6, with mean equals 1.09 and std = 0.4. 不太正常 影响也不大 建议剔除
          
 19  serum creatinine  
         In general, a normal level is 0.7 - 1.3 mg/dL for males and   0.6 - 1.1 mg/dL for females. 
 20  AST     
         enzymes found in the liver. In general, normal levels of AST are between 10 and 40 units per liter (U/L) for men and between 9 and 32 U/L for women. 
 21  ALT                  
         enzymes found in the liver. Normal levels of ALT are between 7 and 55 U/L for men and between 5 and 45 U/L for women.
 22  Gtp                  
          used as a marker of liver function and damage. The normal range for adults is 5 to 40 U/L. A higher result may be a sign of liver damage. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. 大部分比range高 [9]
          High levels of ALP and high levels of GGT means your symptoms are likely due to liver disorder and not a bone disorder.
High levels of ALP and low or normal GGT means it's more likely you have a bone disorder. [8]

Smoking is a significant lifestyle factor that impacts human health. The article discusses the systemic effects of smoking on various organs and systems in the human body, including the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system and immune system. Smoking has systemic effects on the entire body and can increase the risk of a wide range of diseases and health problems. Several health examination tests can be used to detect smoking effects on human body, such as lung function test, chest X-ray, and cancer screening tests. However, these tests are not commonly examined unless one experiences indisposed. Also the lengthy wait time and financial reason need to be considered. On the other hand, even though a health examination does not provide a comprehensive assessment, it is easier to conduct and cost-free. Through the mechanism of smoking-related harm to the body, the health examination can be used to predict whether one is a smoker to study potential health risks with smoking. 


The mechanism of smoking-related harm to the body is complex and multifaceted. Smoking involves inhaling a mixture of chemicals and toxins, which can lead to damage in various parts of the body.

Smoking also affects the cardiovascular system by increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Nicotine in cigarette smoke causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, while the chemicals in the smoke can damage the walls of the arteries and lead to the buildup of plaque, narrowing the arteries and restricting blood flow. This can cause an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, which can be reflected in higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements.

Smoking can increase total cholesterol levels by damaging the walls of blood vessels, which can cause inflammation and the buildup of fatty deposits. Smoking can also decrease HDL cholesterol levels, which are important for removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream. 

Smoking can increase insulin resistance, which in turn can lead to type 2 diabetes. Higher fasting blood sugar levels can be a sign of type 2 diabetes. 

Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, including lung, throat, and mouth, leading to an increased risk of dental caries and tartar buildup. Smoking can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which can lead to higher fasting blood sugar levels.


Based on these mechanisms, we will predict whether an indiviual smokes based on the health parameters of a health examination. We will use a dataset from the National Health Insurance Service of Korea, which collects the results of general health checkups of national health insurance workers, dependents over 40 years of age, local subscribers who are household owners, and local subscribers over 40 years of age, as well as those who have reached the age of 40 and 66 among those eligible for general health checkups.

Abstract: Smoking is one of the major lifestyle factors influencing the health of human beings. Life-long cigarette smokers have a higher prevalence of common diseases such as atherosclerosis and COPD with significant systemic impact. The present review evaluates current knowledge concerning possible pathways through which cigarette smoking can affect human health, with special focus on extrapulmonary effects. Long-term smoke exposure can result in systemic oxidants-antioxidants imbalance as reflected by increased products of lipid peroxidation and depleted levels of antioxidants like vitamins A and C in plasma of smokers. A low-grade systemic inflammatory response is evident in smokers as confirmed by numerous population-based studies: elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and interleukin-6, as well as increased counts of WBC have been reported. Furthermore, rheologic, coagulation and endothelial function markers like hematocrit, blood and/or plasma viscosity, fibrin d-dimer, circulating adhesion molecules (intracellular adhesion molecule-1, selectins), tissue plasminogen activator antigen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type I are altered in chronic cigarette smokers. Although most of smoking-induced changes are reversible after quitting, some inflammatory mediators like CRP are still significantly raised in ex-smokers up to 10 to 20 years after quitting, suggesting ongoing low-grade inflammatory response persisting in former smokers. New longitudinal epidemiologic and genetic studies are required to evaluate the role of smoking itself and possible gene/environment interplay in initiation and development of smoking-induced common diseases affecting humans.
